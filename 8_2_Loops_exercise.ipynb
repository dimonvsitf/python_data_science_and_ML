    "# Python Loops Exercise: Cryptocurrency Wallet Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Description\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "Write a Python script to simulate a simple cryptocurrency wallet tracker. Your script should:\n",
    "            \n",
    "1. Iterate over the list of cryptocurrency transactions: [300, -500, 1000, -2000, 400, -100, 700, -50].\n",
    "2. For each deposit (positive amount), add it to the wallet balance and print \"Deposit processed: [amount]\"\n",
    "3. For each withdrawal (negative amount), check if the wallet balance is sufficient. If so, subtract it from the balance; otherwise, print \"Insufficient funds for this withdrawal: [amount]\" and terminate the loop.\n",
    "4. After each transaction, print the current wallet balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial wallet balance is 1000. Aim to provide clear output showing each transaction's processing and the wallet balance update.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of expected output (not exhaustive):\n",
    "\n",
    "Deposit processed: 300\n",
    "Current balance: 1300\n",
    "...\n",
    "Insufficient funds for this withdrawal: -2000\n",
    "        \n",
    "Hints\n",
    "        \n",
    "Use a for loop to iterate over the list. Utilize if statements to differentiate between deposits and withdrawals. The break statement will help you exit the loop when the balance is insufficient.\n"
